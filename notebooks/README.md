# Cortex Certifai Notebooks
This directory contains *Jupyter notebooks* illustrating how to use Certifai in a notebook environment.

### Azure ML Model Headers Demo

The Azure Model headers demo example notebook highlights the end-to-end process of running a Certifai fairness evaluation by starting with training, testing, and deploying a sklearn model as a web service with token-based Authentication on Azure, using Azure Containerized Instance(ACI) and launching a Certifai model scan on the deployed model in the same notebook. The example notebook can be run either on local machine or on an Azure-hosted notebook environments.

### SHAP

This notebook will run an explainability analysis using SHAP and graph some summary plots of feature importance.
