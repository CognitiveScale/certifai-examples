  description: 'In this use case, each entry in the dataset represents a patient.
    The learning task is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on
    certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.


    Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger
    database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of
    Pima Indian heritage.


    This dataset was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database


    It is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
    Diseases.
