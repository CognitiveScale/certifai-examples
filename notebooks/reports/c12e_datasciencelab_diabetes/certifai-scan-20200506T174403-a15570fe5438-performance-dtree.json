The learning task is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.\n\nSeveral constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\nThis dataset was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database\n\nIt is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n",
