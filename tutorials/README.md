### Bringing In Your Own Model to Certifai Part 1

 Bringing In Your Own Model to Certifai example demonstrates how to create a scan in Certifai using your own model. In this example the model being used is Logistic Regression. We will show how to configure the model to be used in Certifai, and run a scan on it with key evaluation metrics:

 * Fairness
 * Explainability
 * Robustness

The end result will be a scan definition file which contains the meta data from our scan, which can be used for running scans in the CLI and in Part 2 of this tutorial.
