# Cortex Certifai Tutorials 
This directory contains self contained tutorials which walk through various parts of Certifai *outside* of a notebook environment.

### Bringing In Your Own Model CLI

This tutorial continues from part 1 located in the *notebooks* folder. 

This walkthrough will demonstrate how to package and expose a model as a web service using S2i. After that step is complete, the local model will be used to run a Certifai Scan through the CLI with the Scan Definition file.

Prerequisites:

* Certifai Toolkit 
* Scan Definition file (from part 1)
* A model of your choice
* Train and Predict functions for the model
